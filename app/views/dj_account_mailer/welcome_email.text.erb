<%= "Hey #{@user.username}," %>
====================================

Your account on <%= @radio.name %> has been created.

Your username is <%= @user.username %>.
Your password is <%= @password %>. Be sure to change it after you login.

You can log in here.
<%== login_url(host: @radio.virtual_host) %>

For more broadcasting help, check out our <%== link_to "help page.", broadcasting_help_url %>

You can stream to the station using the same login and password from your source client.

If your source client only has a password field, you can enter both the login
and password in the password field, separated by a semicolon ';'.

Feel free to test streaming whenever the schedule is free.
When you have decided when you want to do your show, you can add it to the <%== link_to scheduled_shows_url, "schedule." %>

If you have any questions or need help with anything, just reply to this email!

Thanks
