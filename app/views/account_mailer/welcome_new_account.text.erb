<%= "Hi #{@user.username}," %>

Welcome to Streampusher.

Thanks for signing up. Let me show you how to get started.

The first thing you probably want to do is add some media and create some playlists for your radio to play.

If you want to broadcast live, you can check the instructions for doing so on this page:
<%== broadcasting_help_url %>

Next you can add your live shows to the schedule:
<%== scheduled_shows_url %>

If you are ready to add other DJ accounts to your station, just go here:

If you have any questions, just reply to this email.

Thanks,
-Tony
