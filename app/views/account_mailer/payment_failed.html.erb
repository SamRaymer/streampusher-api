<h2>Payment method failed</h2>

<%= "Hey #{@user.username}," %>

We wanted to let you know that we failed to charge your card for the amount of <%= "#{@invoice.currency} #{@invoice.amount}" %>.

We suggest you update your billing information as soon as possible to prevent your account from being deactivated.
