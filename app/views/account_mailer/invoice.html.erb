<h2>Your invoice</h2>

<%= "Hey #{@user.username}," %>

We wanted to let you know your card was billed automatically for the amount of <%= "#{@invoice.currency} #{@invoice.amount}" %>.

<h3>Invoice ID</h3>
<%= @invoice.id %>
<h3>Plan</h3>
<%= @invoice.plan_id %>
<h3>Credit Card</h3>
<%= @user.subscription.last_4_digits %>

Just a reminder, you can edit your subscription or billing details at any time here:
<%== edit_subscription_url(@user.subscription) %>

Thanks, let us know if you have any questions.
