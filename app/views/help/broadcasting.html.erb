  <h1>BROADCASTING HELP</h1>
  <p>
  Not sure how to broadcast? Here are the steps.
  </p>
  <h1>1. GET AN ICECAST CLIENT</h1>
  <p>
  B.U.T.T. (broadcast using this tool) => <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/butt/">BUTT</a> (mac and windows)
  <br />
  Ladiocast is good for mac => <a href="https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/27022/ladiocast">Ladiocast</a>
  <br />
  Traktor works great too!
  <br />
  Also you can use shoutvst in a DAW like ableton => <a href="http://jsound.org/shoutvst/">shoutvst</a>
  </p>
  </p>
  <h1>2. ENTER YOUR INFO </h1>
  Here is the info you need to enter in order to stream audio to our server. (You can also always see the connection info by clickin the "LIVE" link in the top navbar.)
  <pre>
  host: <%= "#{@current_radio.name}.streampusher.com" %>
  port: <%= @current_radio.liquidsoap_harbor_port %>
  username: your username (<%= current_user.username %>)
  password: your password
  mount: <%= "/#{@current_radio.name}" %>
  </pre>

  <br/>
  <%= image_tag "shoutvst_broadcasting.png" %>
  <br/>

  <h3>I'm using Traktor and there is no username field!</h3>
  There is a workaround for this.
  If your source client does NOT have a username field, you can enter it in the password field in this format:
  <pre>
  password: username and password separated by a semicolon. example: username;password
  </pre>

  <br/>
  <%= image_tag "traktor_broadcasting.png" %>
  <br/>

  <h3>Routing Audio into Ladiocast</h3>

  <p>
  You can use the program Soundflower to route audio to and from programs on your Mac.
