I believe internet radio and streaming events can be improved significantly with today’s technologies. That’s why I’m creating streampusher.

What do you believe is the future of internet radio?

Maybe some people think real radio by real presenters isn’t needed anymore. Services like Spotify and Pandora are growing.

I hope there will always be fans of true radio presented by humans. I don’t think any algorithm will ever replace a good presenter.

Technology should enable and assist great things in the real world, not replace it.

That said, creating an online radio station is a *lot* of work. At the minimum you need to:

- start and manage your streaming server
- recruit DJs and presenters
- scheduling shows
- promoting shows
- manage archives and recordings

In addition, new DJs need to be instructed how to stream, which usually involves
downloading [desktop
software](http://freedrool.us/blog/big-list-of-source-clients), giving them credentials to access the server via their streaming software, setting up their DJ software to output audio to the streaming software, and more.

Streampusher intends to make this easy and will help you every step of the way.

You can add new DJs to your station simply by entering their email address. The new DJ will receive and email automatically with instructions on how to login and stream to the server.

You can schedule shows and programming with the calendar function. You can select a DJ to host the event as well as a backup playlist that will play in the event that the DJ is unable to do the show for any reason, ensuring there is never any dead air.

In the future, streampusher will archive recordings automatically and export them to podcasts or your favorite hosting service like mixcloud or soundcloud.

What about when there is no live DJ, or maybe you just want to play a
pre-arranged playlist of songs on your station 24/7? Use our snappy playlist
editor to get your playlists on the air nearly instantly. Just drag and drop
mp3s or other audio files from your desktop. You can create unlimited playlists
and schedule them to play at certain times with the same scheduling feature you
use to schedule live events.

I’m really excited about what we can do with managing radio stations via a
powerful web interface, there is so much we can automate and make easier.
