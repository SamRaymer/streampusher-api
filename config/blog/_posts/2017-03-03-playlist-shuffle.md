Tired of hearing your playlist in the same order all the time? Now you can
thrive in randomness with the shuffle feature.

Just go to playlist settings and check the "Shuffle" checkbox. The songs in your
playlist will now play in random order.

If you are using the interpolated playlist feature, note that the interpolated
playlist will not play in random order.
