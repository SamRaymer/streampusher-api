You can embed your stream or individual podcasts on your site with our [embedded
player](https://streampusher.com/embeds).

## Embed your stream

Click on the gear icon in the top right, then click
['Embed'](https://streampusher.com/embeds).

Just copy and paste the HTML to your website. You can select a different
background color as well.

## Embed individual tracks

You can also embed individual tracks you've uploaded to Streampusher. They will display the album
artwork as well!

Go to the ['Media'](https://streampusher.com/playlists) page.

Click the pencil edit icon on the track you want to embed.

This is especially useful if you are uploading podcasts. Check out how [Dent
Radio](http://dent-radio.com/) is using them for their podcast episodes.

The embeds should work on any website. Please contact us if you are experiencing
any trouble.
